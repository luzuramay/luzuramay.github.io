    <p>Call you up on a Tuesday</p>
    <p>Say, "What's up? Babe, it's too late</p>
    <p>Why d'you have to be so complicated?"</p>
    <p>Complicated</p>
    <br>
    <p>'Cause I'm not sure if I've seen you before</p>
    <p>You looked familiar when I saw you</p>
    <p>We go together like the gum on my shoes</p>
    <p>We make out, we make out when it's too late</p>
    <p>We go out, we go out on a Tuesday</p>
    <br>
    <p>A crowded place, waitin' for you</p>
    <p>Am I lost? Why can't I find you?</p>
    <p>a silhouette that's in my head</p>
    <p>You don't exist, you're my imagination</p>
    <p>You don't exist, you're just a bad decision</p>
    <br>
    <p>'Cause I'm not sure if I've seen you before</p>
    <p>You looked familiar when I saw you</p>
    <p>We go together like the gum on my shoes</p>
    <p>We make out, we make out when it's too late</p>
    <p>We go out, we go out on a Tuesday</p>
